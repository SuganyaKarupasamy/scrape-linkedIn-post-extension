To load a Chrome extension in Developer Mode, follow these steps:

Step 1: Enable Developer Mode

Open Chrome and go to the Extensions page by navigating to chrome://extensions/ in the address bar.
In the top right corner, enable Developer mode by toggling the switch.

Step 2: Load the Extension

Click the "Load unpacked" button in the top left corner.
In the file dialog that appears, browse to the folder where your extension files are located (the folder containing manifest.json).
Select the folder and click "Select Folder".

Step 3: Verify the Extension

Once the extension is loaded, it will appear in the list of installed extensions on the chrome://extensions/ page.
If there are any issues (e.g., missing files or errors), Chrome will display an error message in the extension list.

Step 4: Test the Extension

You should now be able to use your extension. If it adds an icon to the toolbar, it will appear next to the Chrome address bar.
You can also inspect and debug your extension by clicking the Inspect views link in the list of extensions.

Now your extension is ready for testing in Developer Mode!
